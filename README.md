# Global Covid-19 Vaccination Tracker
The primary objective of this project was to develop a comprehensive system to monitor and analyze the global COVID-19 vaccination trends. In addition, an important aim was to investigate the potential correlation between a nation's economic prosperity, as measured by its GDP, and its vaccination rate, in order to assess the potential advantages of improved health outcomes from economic stability.
